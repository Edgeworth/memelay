## GA
Current fitnesses for selection don't change probabilities that much for actual cost

## Selection strategies
SUS based on fitness
look for maximally different parent

## Diversity
Adaptive mutation rate based on diversity => this is thought to be bad

## Niching
See https://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.05342.pdf

Island model GAs - migration between

Fitness sharing
fitness points shared with neighbours within a certain radius -> can create species and dynamically
adjust distance

sequential fitness sharing - see http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~ksleung/download_papers/Adaptive_population_%20App_Soft_Comp_2011.pdf
